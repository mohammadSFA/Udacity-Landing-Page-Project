# Landing Page Project

This project is to test JavaScript skills learned in Udacity's Frontend Web Development Nanodegree Program.
The goal is to build a working landing page that with a navigation bar that automatically appends itself whenever new sections are added. 

When a section is clicked in the navigation bar, it should scroll down to the corresponding section of the page itself. 
It should be clear which section is being viewed in the page as the user is scrolling.
